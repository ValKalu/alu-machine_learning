#PM2.5 Air Quality Forecasting with LSTMs#
This repository presents a time-series prediction project focused on forecasting PM2.5 levels, a critical air quality indicator, using advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

Our goal was to predict hourly PM2.5 values from a dataset spanning January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014. We specifically addressed the inherent challenges of time-series data, including temporal dependencies and potential distribution shifts between the training and test sets.

This project was developed as part of a Kaggle competition, where we explored various LSTM architectures to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set.
