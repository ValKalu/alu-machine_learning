# TensorFlow Neural Network Project

Objective:
Complete the provided starter code to build, compile, and train a neural network using TensorFlow.

**Participants:**
- [Valentine Kalu]
- [Aubin Ntwali]

**Instructions:**

1. **Load Data:**
   - Choose any dataset and load it using TensorFlow or other relevant libraries.

2. **Preprocess Data:**
   - Define X (features) and Y (labels) clearly according to your chosen dataset.

3. **Model Requirements:**
   - Add at least 1 hidden layer with 128 neurons.
   - Ensure the number of output classes matches your dataset.

4. **Compile and Fit Model:**
   - Use appropriate metrics, optimizer, and loss function for your problem.

5. **Save and Predict:**
   - Include code for saving the trained model and making predictions.

**Submission Details:**

- Submit a notebook (.ipynb) containing your completed project.
- Deadline: 24 hours from the assignment release.

**Rubric:**

- **Data Load (10 pts):**
  - Excellent: Loads the dataset correctly using appropriate libraries.
  - Fair: Loads data other than the MNIST dataset.
  - No Marks: No data loaded.

- **Proof of Participation (15 pts):**
  - Excellent: All team members commit to GitHub.
  - Good: Half the team members commit to the repository.
  - No Marks: No proof provided.

- **Project Execution (60 pts):**
  - Excellent: All notebook cells run without errors.
  - Good: Some cells have errors but functionality mostly intact.
  - Fair: Majority of cells have errors or significant issues.
