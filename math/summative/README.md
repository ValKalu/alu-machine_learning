This is the summative Assignment. You will be optimizing a linear regression model using gradient descent. You have been provided a data set that will create a model that predicts TV sales.

Please find all resources associated with this link.Links to an external site.

Please make a copy first.

Inside you will find a notebook which has instructions. Make sure to note down all cells that require you to complete the code snippets. The notebook has unit tests that you will have to pass. 

The Notebook has 5 Exercises

Further, you will be required to create decision trees and random Forests models compare the Root Mean Squared Errors to the Linear regression model, and rank the models them accordingly

Here is a cheat sheet - LinkLinks to an external site.

Next steps:

Create an API using Fast API

 

Submission Requirements:

 

A GitHub link to the notebook. Make sure all cell outputs are present as this will be used to grade you. An empty cell output will be considered a failed run output.
On the README :
Provide an API endpoint that returns predictions given input values. Tests will be assessed using Postman from my end, alternatively, you can use Swagger UI and provide me with the link.
A video demo of at most 2 minutes of the mobile app doing prediction cameras on.
Note: Use a publicly routable URL, not localhost
